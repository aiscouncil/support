## 7. Privacy and Data Responsibilities

Respecting user privacy is fundamental to our service:

### Your Data Stays on Your Device

AI Supreme Council uses a zero-server architecture. Your conversations, API keys, and bot configurations are stored only in your browser using IndexedDB and localStorage. This data never leaves your device.

### We Never See Your Conversations

When you chat with AI models, your messages go directly from your browser to each AI provider. We have no access to and do not store your conversation content.

### We Never See Your API Keys

Your API keys are stored in your browser's localStorage and sent directly to AI providers. We have no access to them and never store or transmit them to any server.

### Direct Connection to Providers

You communicate directly with third-party AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, xAI, Google, OpenRouter, Ollama). Your relationship with these providers is governed by their own terms of service and privacy policies.

### Your Responsibility for Provider Policies

By using AI providers through the Service, you agree to their terms of service and privacy policies. We encourage you to review each provider's privacy policy, as they are responsible for handling your data.

### We Are Not a Data Processor

Our role is to provide a user interface and connection management. We do not process, analyze, or store your conversations or API keys.

### Shared URLs

When you share a bot configuration via URL, the configuration is encoded in the URL fragment (after `#`). This data is never sent to our servers. Anyone with the URL can access that bot configuration. Do not share URLs containing sensitive information.

## 8. Consequences of Violations

Violations of this AUP may result in the following actions, at our sole discretion:

Disabling specific features (e.g., bot sharing, council mode) while maintaining basic access.

### Permanent Termination
