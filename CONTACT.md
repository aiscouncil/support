## Before You Write

For faster resolution, please:

1. **Check the FAQ** - Your question may already be answered
2. **Try a different browser** - Some issues are browser-specific
3. **Clear your cache** - Old cached data can cause issues
4. **Check your API keys** - Ensure they're valid and have sufficient credits

### Browser-Specific Issues

If something isn't working in your browser:

- Try Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (latest versions)
- Check that JavaScript and cookies are enabled
- Disable browser extensions temporarily to test for conflicts
- Try incognito/private browsing mode

### API Key Issues

If your API key isn't working:

- Copy the key directly from the provider's dashboard
- Check that it's an API key (not an account key)
- Verify the key has the required permissions
- Ensure the key hasn't been revoked or expired
- Try generating a new key from the provider console

---

## Common Quick Fixes

### "My bot URL isn't working"

- Copy the full URL from the address bar, not from a chat message
- Verify your API keys are configured in Settings
- Some messaging apps truncate long URLs — share via email or direct link instead

### "I can't see my local Ollama models"

- Make sure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Check that the API is accessible at `http://localhost:11434`
- Download a model first: `ollama pull llama3`

### "Council mode shows an error"

- Council mode requires a Lite subscription
- Ensure at least 2 models are selected
- Check that your API keys have sufficient credits

### "My conversations disappeared"

- Conversations are stored in your browser's IndexedDB
- They may have been deleted if you cleared browser data
- Check if you're logged into the same account (if using authenticated mode)
- Export conversations regularly as backup

---

## Data Backup & Recovery

Your data is stored locally in your browser. To protect it:

### Backup

1. Open any conversation
2. Click "Export" button
3. Choose JSON format for full backup
4. Save the file to your computer

### Restore

1. Go to Settings in the app
2. Click "Import"
3. Select your backup JSON file
4. Your conversations will be restored

**Important:** Clearing your browser data permanently deletes all conversations. Export backups regularly.
